# Introduction

The [RISCOSS project](http://www.riscoss.eu) will offer novel risk identification, management and mitigation tools and methods for community-based and industry-supported OSS development.

RISCOSS will deliver a decision-making management platform integrated in a business-oriented decision-making framework, which together support placing technical OSS adoption decisions into organizational, business strategy and broader OSS community context.

This is the main repository for the RISCOSS Platform code. Detailed information about the project and how to contribute them detailed in  [this repository wiki](https://github.com/RISCOSS/riscoss-githubanalyzer/wiki)

Please refer to the [RISCOSS White Paper](http://www.riscoss.eu/bin/download/Discover/Whitepaper/RISCOSS-Whitepaper.pdf) for a more detailed description.
