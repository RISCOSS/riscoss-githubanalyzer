# Introduction

The [RISCOSS project](http://www.riscoss.eu) will offer novel risk identification, management and mitigation tools and methods for community-based and industry-supported OSS development. 

RISCOSS will deliver a decision-making management platform integrated in a business-oriented decision-making framework, which together support placing technical OSS adoption decisions into organizational, business strategy and broader OSS community context.

This is the main repository for the RISCOSS Platform code. Detailed information about the project and how to contribute them detailed in  [this repository wiki](https://github.com/RISCOSS/riscoss-platform-core/wiki)

# Project structure

The project structure reflects the structure of the RISCOSS Platform architecture:

* riscoss-platform-dm contains the code of the Domain Manager (DM)
* riscoss-platform-rdr contains the code for the Risk Data Repository (RDR)
* riscoss-platform-analyser is the engine which calculates risk based on data-points stored in the RDR.
* riscoss-platform-jsmile is a wrapper around the proprietary jSmile project which is used by the riscoss-platform-analyser.
